## How The Game Works

##### Definitions

- **Octilinear line - a horizontal, vertical, or 45Â° diagonal line**

##### Rules

- **The game is played on a 4x4 grid of 16 nodes.**

- **Players take turns drawing octilinear lines connecting nodes.**

- **Each line must begin at the start or end of the existing path, so that all lines form a continuous path.**

- **The first line may begin on any node.**

- **A line may connect any number of nodes.**

- **Lines may not intersect.**

- **No node can be visited twice.**

- **The game ends when no valid lines can be drawn.**

- **The player who draws the last line is the loser.**

All Elm client code was written by KMBS Solutions Engineering Center.

I wrote the game server code and added some client side features.
